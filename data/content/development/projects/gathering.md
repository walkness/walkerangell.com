Thie is a project on which I have assisted its founders in several different capacities; in one of which I designed and built this basic landing page. The main goal of the page is to begin building awareness of the company and to drive signups from people and potential design partners.

Built as a static site in React, the site is able to be hosted very economically on AWS S3, while boasting high performance and reliability.
