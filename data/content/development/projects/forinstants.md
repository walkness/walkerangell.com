#### Background

My wife writes, and I photograph, for a blog called For Instants. It originally started as a "journal", and has become more of a travel blog.

#### Development Work

I developed a custom WordPress theme, including custom taxonomies to organize our travel, as can be seen on our [travel](https://walkandalie.com/travel/) and [trips](https://walkandalie.com/trips/) pages.
