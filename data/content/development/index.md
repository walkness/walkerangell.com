I have always loved building things, and got hooked on development while I was at university and wanted to build a new site for the student radio station. I taught myself enough PHP/[Drupal](https://www.drupal.com/), HTML and CSS to hack away at that site, and loved it.

Since then, I've continued to learn new languages and technologies, and love being able to realize a variety of ideas into actual products. Today, a few of my favorite things as a developer include Python/Django, ES6/React (especially React's ability to be rendered server-side, or in advance as a static-site generator), Swift 2, and Amazon Web Services.

I love working on interesting projects, and enjoy helping designers code their ideas. I've built everything from simple landing pages to full web applications and native iOS applications, and a lot of basic websites in between.
