#### Background

Scholastic runs an annual contest to recognize new, high-quality toys, and needed a simple, static site to promote the contest to toy manufacturers. The site's content needed to be easily editable so that it could be reused on an annual basis. I worked with Scholastic's designers to develop a fun site that compiles to static HTML files hosted by Scholastic.

#### Development Work

I used my go-to static site generator, React, to build this site. The source code is well-organized, and componentized, to make it as easy as possible to make updates to the site. CSS modules keep all the site's class names locally scoped, which not only makes development and maintenance of the site easier, but also keeps classes from conflicting with the Scholastic envelope in which this site is embedded.
