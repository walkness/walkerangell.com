title: Development
---
I have always loved building things, and got hooked on development while I was at university and wanted to build a new site for the student radio station. I taught myself enough PHP/[Drupal](https://www.drupal.com/), HTML and CSS to hack away at that site, and loved it.

Since then, I've continued to learn new languages and technologies, and love being able to realize a variety of ideas. Today, a few of my favorite things as a developer include Python/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), ES6/[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (especially React's ability to be rendered server-side, or in advance as a static-site generator), [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

I love working on interesting projects, and enjoy helping designers code their ideas. I've built everything from simple landing pages to full web applications and native iOS applications, and a lot of basic websites in between.
