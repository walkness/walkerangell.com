#### Background

In conjunction with this law firm's transition to a new firm, they were ending their subscription to the service that provided their website. However, the client wanted to keep their site's content accessible for search purposes, and direct visitors to their new firm.

#### Development Work

As a site that would not require much updating, and that needed to be hosted indefinitely for as cheaply as possible, a static site was an obvious solution. I used React to build a static site, designed similarly to the client's previous site, that is hosted for pennies on AWS S3. As a perk of using React, not only does the initial page load very quickly, but the site can be navigated with no latency.
