#### Background

I worked with [Elisign Design](http://elisigndesign.com/) to develop a new site for a group of business software consultants. The NBN Group was looking for a platform that would just provide a simple informational site and blog at first, but that could easily handle additions of more complex features, like stores, as they grow. Additionally, the client wanted to be able to make many changes to the site themselves, requiring a clean CMS implementation making virtually all of the site easily editable and re-arrangeable.

#### Development Work

To make the site both performant, flexible, and easily editable, I recommended the implementation of Craft CMS. On the backend, I worked with Elisign Design, and the client, to model their data in the CMS's database optimally. On the frontend, I worked from Photoshop files provided by Elisign Design to develop custom templates for the site and its various pages.

In addition to the public site, I also worked with Elisign Design to develop custom documentation for using and editing the site using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).
